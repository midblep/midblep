## **Hello, I'm Pascal** (Mid or Midblep on the interwebs)

🤝 I am a versatile full-stack software developer. I know my way around many languages and am always eager to learn new things. I work with a variety of frameworks like Laravel, NestJS and SvelteKit. My favorite languages are TypeScript, Python, PHP and Rust.

🎒 I am currently studying Software Engineering at the Saxion University of Applied Sciences and specialize in web related development.

💼 I run my own development studio called DubbelNull that specializes in creating websites and designs. Next to that I am also Lead Developer at Flame Software, a SaaS company trying to revolutionize online communications.

💻 I enjoy coding beyond work, but am also into tons of other tech like building computers, playing games, managing networks/infrastructure and flying drones!
