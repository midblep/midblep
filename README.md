### Hi there 👋

🤝 I am a very versatile full-stack software engineer. I know my way around many languages and work with a variety of frameworks/libraries like Laravel, NestJS, React and Svelte. I also do lower-cost Wordpress and small pure-JS projects.

🎒 I am currently studying Software Engineering at the Saxion University of Applied Sciences and specialize in web related development.

💼 I run my own development studio called DubbelNull that specializes in creating websites and designs. Next to that I am also Lead Developer at Flame Software, a SaaS company trying to revolutionize online communications.

😸 On the internet I am Mid (also Midblep or Midnight), a tall black cat with blue hair. He is my fursona and digital representation.

💻 I enjoy coding beyond work, but am also into tons of other tech like building computers, playing games, managing networks/infrastructure and flying drones!
