## 👋 I'm Pascal, a 23 year old programmer and tech enthusiast from The Netherlands.

🤝 I am a versatile full-stack software developer. I know my way around many languages and am always eager to learn new things. I have extensively worked with a variety of frameworks like Laravel, NestJS, SvelteKit, .NET Core and Blazor. My favorite languages to work in are TypeScript / JavaScript, Python, PHP, C# and Rust.

🏗️ Beyond just programming with text I also have a lot of experience in a lot of auxiliary topics such as Linux, server management and architecture, Microsoft Azure, CI/CD and pipelines, Docker and Swarm/Kubernetes, observability with Grafana and other tools, etc.

🎓 I obtained a Bachelor of Science majoring in Software Engineering at the Saxion University of Applied Sciences in The Netherlands. During the study I've done a multitude of projects for clients and worked in teams comprised of people with lots of different backgrounds.

💼 I like to keep busy and continue developing my skills as a hobby. I run a small scale webdevelopment studio and am part of two ambitious SaaS projects in the medical and social sector. Next to that I like to volunteer for things I am passionate about. Currently I am working as aBackend Developer for one of the largest online conventions called Furality, and also as the Frontend Team Lead for an in-person convention called Reffurence. Check out my experiences section for even more projects I've made and been apart of.

💻 I enjoy coding beyond work, but am also into tons of other tech like building computers, playing games, drone flying and 3D printing!

#### **Note**

My projects are spread over different platforms, such as GitLab, GitHub and my own self-hosted Git repositories. You can find them all through my personal website linked below.
