## **Hello, I'm Pascal** (Mid or Midblep on the interwebs)

🤝 I am a versatile full-stack software developer. I know my way around many languages and am always eager to learn new things. I have extensively worked with a variety of frameworks like Laravel, NestJS, SvelteKit and Blazor. My favorite languages are TypeScript / JavaScript, Python, PHP, C# and Rust.

🎒 I am currently studying Software Engineering at the Saxion University of Applied Sciences and specialize in web related development. I will be graduating in a few months.

💼 I run my own development studio called DubbelNull that creates programs and sites related to the web, including portfolios, APIs, apps, etc.

💻 I enjoy coding beyond work, but am also into tons of other tech like building computers, playing games, managing networks/infrastructure, flying drones and 3D printing!


## **Note**

My projects are spread over different platforms, such as GitLab, GitHub and my own self-hosted Git repositories. You can find them all through my personal website linked below.
